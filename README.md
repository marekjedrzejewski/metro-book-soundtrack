# metro-book-soundtrack
Simple script downloading all music tracks from metro book website.

Metro 2033 was released freely on the author website with links to tracks that author thought to be good to listen to while reading. As the website contains russian version, and there may be people that don't know russian, or don't know it well enough to read the book there with the soundtrack. I wrote the script to download all the tracks.

Writen in Python3.
